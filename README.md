## IFileAdapter

The `IFileAdapter` interface provides a minimal file-system abstraction for testing purposes. It allows you to mock file operations such as writing to a file and deleting a file.

### Usage Example

```csharp
using CoubDownloader.Tests;

public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IFileAdapter _fileAdapter;

    public MyClass(IFileAdapter fileAdapter)
    {
        _fileAdapter = fileAdapter;
    }

    public void WriteToFile(string path, string contents)
    {
        _fileAdapter.WriteAllText(path, contents);
    }

    public void DeleteFile(string path)
    {
        _fileAdapter.Delete(path);
    }
}
```
